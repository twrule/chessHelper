# chessHelper

This is a command-line script/program that helps the user learn the basic mechanics of chess peices and how each individual piece moves.

To run the program download all relevant files, navigate to the directory the files are located in, type "make" on the command-prompt to compile all the files, then type either java chessHelper or make run to begin the prompt.

I plan on having the file format as a chessHelper file and then an individual file for each chess piece that will be appropriately called/utilized when the user decides the piece they are studying

I am also using this program to begin learning vim
